    "text": "People want to use reconviction rates as a performance metric\nThe Sentencing Council (for England and Wales) says the reconviction rate is a “key metric for evaluating the effectiveness of sentencing” (gormley2022:18?)\n“Reduced reoffending is an important objective that can facilitate desistance and reintegration. While reducing reoffending is important, in the absence of reintegration or desistance, reductions in offending are less likely to persist. Yet, reoffending can be a more quantifiable metric which has advantages – though care must still be taken as there are different definitions of reoffending” (gormley2022:5?). Basically it can help measure the ‘effectiveness’ of sentencing (… if imperfectly).\n“The ability to compare and discuss trends in reoffending is important to its usefulness as a performance target within government” (browne2024?)\n\nThe logic is that if the reconviction rate goes down then the criminal justice system is doing a better job at rehabilitating offenders\n“Reduce reconviction rates” was a National Performance Framework indicator until (at least) 2017 (Scottish Government 2017)"

At least we can measure reconviction easily\n\nA ‘target population’: “over whom or what do we aggregate that unit-specific quantity”\nThe annual reconviction rate aggregates over the population who could have been reconvicted in each year. // take this from the demography literature\nBecause of changes in the distribution of characteristics of the people who have been convicted change in the overall reconviction rate can be biased. The overall change we see will be both due to changes in the prevalence of reconviction amongst demographic groups, but also the mix/composition of those groups who are in each reconviction cohort."

This is conceptually similar - for a given year you get a counterfactual reconviction rate assuming that the population structure of each year was the same (standardization)\nThis approach also easily lets you see how much of the overall change in the reconviction rate is due to changes in reconvictions, and how much is due to changing demographics (decomposition)\nWe use the methods described by (Das Gupta 1993) (building on Kitagawa (1955)) as implemented in the {dasguptr} R package (king2025?)"

However, as shown in figure 1, when the data is broken down by gender, the 2002/03 rates for men and for women were actually the highest on record over the eight-year period … This can be explained in part by the fact that the proportion of women in the cohort has increased from 14% in 1995 to 16% in 2002/03 (Scottish Executive, 2001), and that women have a notably lower reconviction rate than men (37% compared with 47%; Scottish Executive, 2006b). That is, the sample now contains a higher proportion of people who have a lower likelihood of being reconvicted … This means that a headline reduction in reconvictions in line with targets might be due to a change in the gender balance of the incarcerated population, rather than the success of any policy or intervention. If the target for a reduction in the overall reconviction rate is met, and this is mainly due to more people with a lower likelihood of re-offending being brought into the criminal justice system and being convicted, rather than through a reduction in rates of re-offending among those who would normally be brought into the system, this would bring little cause for celebration.” (kirkwood2008?)"

You can have changes in the rate due to changes in the means or changes in the rates.\nThis is known as the amalgamation paradox (Good and Mittal 1987) or Simpson’s Simpson (1951) paradox\nBecause of changes in the distribution of characteristics of the people who have been convicted change in the overall reconviction rate can be biased.

    "text": "Analysis\n\nThe dramatic changes in the demographics of people involved in the justice system that we have seen in Scotland distorts simple comparisons over time in aggregate performance measures such as the reconviction rate, because the people who made up reconviction cohorts in the late 1990s have a very different demographic profile to those who make up reconvictions cohorts in the mid 2020s\nYoung people used to have the highest reconviction rate of all age groups, but this is has fallen\nThose over 40 have consistently lower reconviction rates, but these have not fallen\nYoung people also used to make up more of the reconviction cohorts\nIn terms of the overall reconviction rate, a group of people with high levels of reconviction have been replaced by people with lower levels of reconviction"

    "text": "Analysis\n\nWe can attribute about three-quarters of the fall in the reconvictions rate in Scotland between 1997/98-2020/21 to demographic change in the population of people convicted, rather than falls in the reconviction rate per se.1\nIf you want to use the reconviction rate as a measure of sentencing effectiveness or similar, you would think the justice system is doing a much better job than it is\nIn an optimistic reading the change in the mix of people being reconvicted could still be due to criminal justice practices (e.g. more diversion from prosecution for young people), but is not attributable to the ‘effectiveness’ of the criminal justice system in rehabilitating offenders - it is purely due to changes in the demographic mix of people being convicted in the first place\nAn alternative perspective: the criminal justice system is benefiting from the impacts of wider societal change where young people are less likely to be involved in offending, as well as lots of other ‘risky’ behaviours (Ball et al. 2023)\n\nIf you change the comparison years to compare a year in the 2000s to 2020/1 this falls to around half of the overall change attributable to changes in age structure."

Following consultation with key users, the decision was taken to exclude this from future publications to avoid confusion in he interpretation of findings.\n\n(Browne 2024, p19)"
